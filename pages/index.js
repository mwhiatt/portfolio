        <p>
            I am an aspiring software engineer currently entering the 3rd year of a 3+1 combined Computer Science B.S./M.S. program.
            Hence, I will be graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science as well as Mathematics in the Spring of 2024, and a Master's
            in Computer Science in the Spring of 2025. My degree concentration is in cybersecurity, however I have a wide array of interests
            in Software Development. I have experience in systems programming with C/C++, frontend development with Javascript (React), HTML, 
            and CSS, and backend development in Java and Javascript (NodeJS.)
