                I am an aspiring software engineer currently entering the 3rd year of a 3+1 combined Computer Science B.S./M.S. program.
                Hence, I will be graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science as well as Mathematics in the Spring of 2024, and a Master's
                in Computer Science in the Spring of 2025. My degree concentration is in cybersecurity, however I have a wide array of interests
                in Software Development. I have experience in systems programming with C/C++, frontend development with Javascript and Typescript (React), HTML, 
                and CSS, and backend development in Java and Javascript (NodeJS.)
